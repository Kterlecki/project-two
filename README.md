# The Foodies!

In this project I focused on trying to create a modern website for the Foodies company. Foodies provides a destinations for customers who are looking for better food choices. Currently we have two cities on the map and we are looking to expand our network. Each city has a number of restaurants marked which provide a service that will help you to find your perfect meal

We are also keen on hearing from you and thats why we have included a suggestion form which will be used to expand our network.

Please find a live Demo of the website below:

# UX
This website is primarly aimed at people who are consious of  their diet and want to make better food choices. Healthy eating is becoming very popular and we believe that a lot of people are not willing to compromise their diet. This website is for all age groups and genders. Each page provides the necessary information and/or inter activeness to try and make it enjoyable to go through each page. The website also provides an easily accesible map so that the user can access our suggestions quickly

The website also provides a suggestion form. This is an important feature for a number of reasons. This will not only increase our network but it also should build a loyal fan base. People like to share their experiences.

The site used HTML5, CSS3 and JS to a level reached in module 1-5 of this course.

The UI colors that were chosen for this project emphasise each section and make it easily legible.

# Features

## Foodies (homepage)

The Foodies main page is based on a carousel of three images and text. Each image switches after a given period of time. Each image also has a different Paragraph written on it. This section is interactive de

## Map

The Map provides a number of destinations which have been suggested to the user

## Suggestions 

This page provides a user the ability to share with us food places which they think are worth while visiting. The information they provide is then sent to us via email. All fields must be filled in for emial to send.



## Other Features

Social links- social links are present in the footer which would allow a user to access different social media accounts. Each link brings the user to the desired page

## Plans for improvement

I would like to improve the functionality of the map. I would do this by adding filters for different cuisines types. I would also add ratings and opinion windows to the each restaurant.

A reward system for providing good suggestions for food places. Each suggestion would give a user a certain amount of points which then could be used for discounts.

## Technologies Used

HTML5 -HTML 5 was used as it uses semantic markups to effectively design webages.

CSS3

was used for styling and layout options of the HTML pages.

Bootstrap 4

-was used to style and help with certain aspects of the layout of the HTML page

JS

# Testing

Testing was carried out on each navigation button on each site to ensure the links are working correctly. Other testing that was performed was the responsiveness of the website on mobile, tablet and desktop. Both portrait and landscape was tested.

googole developer tools was used to test the website on all different screen resolutions available and switching from landscape to portrait modes.

The code was also tested on html and css validator

The entire website was tested on responsinator just in case anything was missed on googole developer tools

Was also tested on real life devices like :

-Samsung S8 and S5

-Iphone X

## Responsive testing

The website has been designed to be responsive to different screen sizes. This was achieved by using Bootstrap.

Deployment

I decided to use github to host my webpage. I found a guide on how to do this on the following page:

Github Pages Guide
One of the main reasons why I decided to use github is that we have used it through the course and I feel relatively familiar with it. It also helps that its free. It also extremely easy to use as it can host your webpage aslong as your code is present. This required no extra configurations.
